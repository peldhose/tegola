Tegola is a vector tile server delivering [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) leveraging PostGIS as the data provider.

## Features
- Native geometry processing (simplification, clipping, make valid, intersection, contains, scaling, translation)
- [Mapbox Vector Tile v2 specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) compliant.
- Embedded viewer with auto generated style for quick data visualization and inspection.
- Support for PostGIS as a data provider. Extensible to support additional data providers.
- Local filesystem caching. Extensible design to support additional cache backends.
- Cache seeding to fill the cache prior to web requests.
- Parallelized tile serving and geometry processing.
- Support for Web Mercator (3857) and WGS84 (4326) projections.

```

## Running tegola as a vector tile server
1. Download the appropriate binary of tegola for your platform via the [release page](https://github.com/terranodo/tegola/releases).
2. Setup your config file and run. Tegola expects a `config.toml` to be in the same directory as the binary. You can set a different location for the `config.toml` using a command flag:

```
./tegola serve --config=/path/to/config.toml
```

## Server Endpoints

```
/
```

The server root will display a built in viewer with an auto generated style. For example:

![tegola built in viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terranodo/tegola/v0.4.0/docs/screenshots/built-in-viewer.png "tegola built in viewer")


```
/maps/:map_name/:z/:x/:y
```

Return vector tiles for a map. The URI supports the following variables:

- `:map_name` is the name of the map as defined in the `config.toml` file.
- `:z` is the zoom level of the map.
- `:x` is the row of the tile at the zoom level.
- `:y` is the column of the tile at the zoom level.


```
/maps/:map_name/:layer_name/:z/:x/:y
```

Return vector tiles for a map layer. The URI supports the same variables as the map URI with the additional variable:

- `:layer_name` is the name of the map layer as defined in the `config.toml` file.


```
/capabilities
```

Return a JSON encoded list of the server's configured maps and layers with various attributes.

```
/capabilities/:map_name
```

Return [TileJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec) details about the map.

```
/capabilities/:map_name/style.json
```

Return an auto generated [Mapbox GL Style](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/) for the configured map.

## Configuration
The tegola config file uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format. The following example shows how to configure a PostGIS data provider with two layers. The first layer includes a `tablename`, `geometry_field` and an `id_field`. The second layer uses a custom `sql` statement instead of the `tablename` property.

Under the `maps` section, map layers are associated with data provider layers and their `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` values are defined. Optionally, `default_tags` can be setup which will be encoded into the layer. If the same tags are returned from a data provider, the data provider's values will take precedence.

```toml

port = ":9090"              # port to bind the web server to. defaults ":8080"

	# Custom sql to be used for this layer. Note: that the geometery field is wraped

```

### Supported PostGIS SQL tokens
The following tokens are supported in custom SQL queries for the PostGIS data provider:

- `!BBOX!` - [required] Will convert the z/x/y values into a bounding box to query the feature table with.
- `!ZOOM!` - [optional] Pass in the zoom value for the request. Useful for filtering feature results by zoom.

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables can be used for debugging:

`SQL_DEBUG` specify the type of SQL debug information to output. Currently support two values:

- `LAYER_SQL`: print layer SQL as they are parsed from the config file.
- `EXECUTE_SQL`: print SQL that is executed for each tile request and the number of items it returns or an error.

#### Usage

```bash
$ SQL_DEBUG=LAYER_SQL tegola -config=/path/to/conf.toml
```

The following environment variables can be use to control various runtime options:

`TEGOLA_OPTIONS` specify a set of options comma (or space) seperated options.

- `DontSimplifyGeo` to turn off simplification for all layers.
- `SimplifyMaxZoom={{int}}` to set the max zoom that simplification will apply to. (14 is default)


## Client side debugging
When debugging client side, it's often helpful to to see an outline of a tile along with it's Z/X/Y values. To encode a debug layer into every tile add the query string variable `debug=true` to the URL template being used to request tiles. For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/maps/mymap/{z}/{x}/{y}.vector.pbf?debug=true
```

The requested tile will be encode a layer with the `name` value set to `debug` and include two features:

 - `debug_outline`: a line feature that traces the border of the tile
 - `debug_text`: a point feature in the middle of the tile with the following tags:
   - `zxy`: a string with the `Z`, `X` and `Y` values formatted as: `Z:0, X:0, Y:0`

## Building from source

Tegola is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and requires Go 1.8+ to compile from source. To build tegola from source, make sure you have Go installed and have cloned the repository to your `$GOPATH`. Navigate to the repository then run the following commands:

```bash
cd cmd/tegola/
go build -o tegola
```

You will now have a binary named `tegola` in the current directory which is [ready for running](#running-tegola).
